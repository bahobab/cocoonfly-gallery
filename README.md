# cocoonfly.com

Cocoonfly.com is a website to showcase art work from selected Nigerian artists.
You will see:

- Events produced by Cocoonfly Gallery
- Artists' bio

## The cocoonfly.com Website

This is a Jamstack website built with Gatsby for the front end static site generator, Strapi for the backend logic, and Cloudinary for cloud-based image management and repository.

## Site Performance

The website passes the Google mobile test as well as Lighthouse audits.
Code split using React.lazy() to lazy-load components (https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html)
Image optimization techniques to improve performace using resources listed here: https://web.dev/uses-responsive-images/?utm_source=lighthouse&utm_medium=devtools
In addition I used this site to adjust/fix images aspect ratio: https://croppola.com/

Below are the screenshots for the different tests and audits
